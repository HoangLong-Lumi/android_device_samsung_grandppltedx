# Device Tree for Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime (SM-G532x)

TESTING:
* Doze/Battery Life

WORKING ON:
* Cleaning up whole tree, standardize, etc~
* SELinux
* Proper-izing roodir stuff

CURRENTLY NOT WORKING/BUGGY:
* Headphone not working
* GPS (bin runs but doesn't work)
* Camera: Video Recording not working
* RadioFM not working
* No Icon/Percentage while offline charging. (it still charges.)
* Manually configure for 2 active SIMs.

WON'T FIX:
* VoLTE. No Samsung dev has managed to port SRIL IMS to AOSP, so I'd say 'impossible to fix'.


DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS, MAY EAT YOUR CAT.
